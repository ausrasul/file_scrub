
Checks file's CRC32 agains previously saved CRC to detect bit level file corruption.
Does not automatically recover corrupted data. (To do)

Usage:

- Calculate:
    - Drag the files you want to calculate their CRC and drop them on the "calculate.bat" file.
    - Or run calculate.bat [files_their_CRC_to_be_registered]
    
- Check:
    - Periodically drag the files and drop them on the "check.bat" file to check if they match their previously calculated CRC.
    - Or run check.bat [files_to_check_their_crc_agains_previously_saved_value]
