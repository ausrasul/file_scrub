Calculates files CRC32 and store the hash, to later check for CRC changes and detect bit level file corruption.

Usage:
- Calculate: drag the files you want to calculate their CRC and drop them on the "calculate.bat" file.
- Check: Periodically drag the files and drop them on the "check.bat" file to check if they match their previously calculated CRC.
